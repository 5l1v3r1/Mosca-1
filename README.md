 Manual analysis tool to find bugs like a grep unix command, Version 0.05  

because is not dynamic... uses static code to search... don't confuse with academic views hahaha 
don't have graph here or CFG... is a simple "grep"


*egg modules is a config to find to vulnerabilities

*you can use at C, PHP, javascript, ruby etc

*Save results at XML file

*create your own modules etc...

*why static ?
